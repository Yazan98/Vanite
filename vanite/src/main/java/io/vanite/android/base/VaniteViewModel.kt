 * VortexViewModel is the initial point at application logic
 * this class should always notify the View about his state because (The View) at application don't know abything
 * about application just apply the incoming state from ViewModel To View
 *
 * Supported Views -> (Activity , Fragment)
 *
 * @param State : This Param is The Current State About The ViewModel Like THis
 * AuthState -> (SuccessAuthState , ErrorAuthState , LoadingAuthState , EmptyAuthState , BlockedAuthState)
 * and you should at this type of viewModel handle each state at stateObserver using acceptNewState()
 *
 * @param Action : This Action is Really Important because The View can just do Two Things
 * 1. Apply The Last State At ViewModel
 * 2. Submit View Actions From User To ViewModel
 *
 * Examples:
 * AuthRegisterAction should send the User Information To ViewModel To Execute The Register Steps
 * AuthLoginAction Should send The Auth Information (Email , Password) To ViewModel Via Action
 *
 * Each Method At ViewModel executed On Background Thread And The View Handler Should Apply The Result On Main Thread
